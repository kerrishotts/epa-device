# Extending PhoneGap Apps: Device Plugin

(for Packt Publishing's Extending PhoneGap Apps video course, by Kerri Shotts)

This repository has a simple app that demonstrates how the device plugin can be installed and used. 

## Pre-requisites

### Local build

Make sure that you have the following installed:

* Node & npm
* Appropriate device platform SDKs (Android, iOS, etc.)
* Either of `phonegap` or `cordova` CLIs

### PhoneGap Build

PhoneGap Build should work as long as you point it at the project's repository (not at the code package for the course videos).

* Repository: https://github.com/kerrishotts/epa-device

If you want to run on an iOS device, you'll need to add your own iOS key.
